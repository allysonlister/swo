# The Software Ontology Release Notes

http://theswo.sourceforge.net

* VERSION: 1.6
* DATE: 1 February 2017

# Summary

Release 1.6 contains many new license classes in collaboration with the BioSharing project (http://www.biosharing.org). It is also the first release on GitHub.

To create the inferred file, we removed two EDAM classes as they were unsatisfiable when the reasoner was run. These classes are http://edamontology.org/data_1022 (sequence feature label) and http://edamontology.org/operation_3200 (community profiling). These two classes remain within both swo_merged.owl and the development version of SWO.
